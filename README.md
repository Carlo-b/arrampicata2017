# Arrampicata2017
This was a school group project and I (Carlo Blasi) focused mainly on the design of the point-taking section of the web app. Unfortunately, our project was not selected to be used in the actual contest.

# User Interface
A minimalist approach was taken in designing the interface, the number of elements on the screen is kept to a minimum and every button is quite big to ease the interaction and the navigation.
